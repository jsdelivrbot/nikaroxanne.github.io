As a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, I am exploring computer science as a medium for artistic expression in the modern era. I recently returned from a year studying in Paris, where I  studied at Université Paris I and III as well as L’école Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. I am currently a fourth-year student in the dual degree program at Tufts and the SMFA, where I am pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, French and Fine Arts. 

I currently work as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science Department at Tufts for the Web Programming course. I also work as a Lab Assistant in the Digital Design Studio at Tisch Library. I am bilingual in English and French and also hopes to become fluent in the other several languages which I currently study: Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Russian. I plan to continue my studies in Computer Science and Painting in Europe after graduating from the dual degree program, combining my affinity for languages with my two passions.

This website serves as a portfolio for my visual artwork (painting, drawing, mixed media with code) as well as my writing portfolio (poetry and prose).
