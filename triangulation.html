		<h1> Applications of Delaunay Triangulation Algorithms and Edge Flipping in Facial Recognition</h1>
		<h2> (subtitle: Make Yourself Cubist) </h2> 

		<p class = "opening1"> There is a brief moment in the interim, between pressing the screen and when a cascade of filter options appear, when the Snapchat screen makes itself vulnerable — or seemingly so. Perhaps the algorithm (point location, triangulation, alpha mask generation, etc.) is simply not fast enough to go unnoticed. Or perhaps, in hinting a glimpse at your triangular decomposition, a user  feels that tantalizing endorphin-surging rush of peeking behind the curtain as the Wizard soliloquizes about the mysteries of the “cloud."</p>

		<p class = "opening2"> Or perhaps, like most users, you never noticed the triangular mesh on your hurried way to transfigure yourself into some canonical dog-eared millennial archetype. That’s about to change. </p>

		<p class = "why"> Why? </p>

		<p class = "opening3"> We delineate spaces without thinking. This is a way to think about how we create referential landmarks to ourselves and to other points. This is an exploration of space, divisions of space and the landmarks we forget to notice on the landscapes that we most frequently apotheosize and excoriate concurrently — our own faces. </p>

		<p class = "slide1"> 1. Refinement using Gaussian filter </p>

		<p class = "slide1"> Understanding the process of triangulating a selected face region (i.e. what we need so we can put a cutesy infantilizing dog filter on it!) requires understanding how a computer understands a photograph. </p>
