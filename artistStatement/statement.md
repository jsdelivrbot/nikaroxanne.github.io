At the intersection of computer science and painting, my works finds a rooted commonality in themes of code, data, structure and form. 

My work is centered around concepts integral to computational geometry -- triangulation, or a method of decomposing a polygon into triangles. I create layered self-portraits, painting my own image and then destroying and reconstructing it to reveal a conglomeration of data. 

Referencing the stability and regularity of geometry, particularly the triangle, allows me to interrogate those shapes associated with power structures in society. The deconstruction of my own body into triangles gives me a new capacity to dismantle the power of the triangle while revealing the vulnerability of interior layers to the form. In this sense, shapes are both deprecated and elevated and the body is revealed to be a multilayered composition of data, paralleling computer programs, networks. 

My oil paintings reference the work of old Masters in order to create a rupture between depicted modern technology -- shown through geometric algorithmic depictions -- and a reverential view of classical European portraiture. This discussion between antiquity and modernity is brought to the forefront in my works, as is the nature of code -- to hide or conceal or transform a piece of data, to make new from layers of old.
