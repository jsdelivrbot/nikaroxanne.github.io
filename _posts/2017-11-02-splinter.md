I draw you a picture and then I veer
Though the intersection, left turn only
On the red light
I think I’m speeding to hit
The lamppost, recurl my body
Reverse metamorphosis return
To chrysalis, I’d like to feel warm
for once.
Maybe all of my speech is involuntary
Lifted memories of grafts
Spliced off from your voice in the auditorium
I hid in the Roman amphitheater
(Called vomitorium) where I learned
The practice of self-mutilation
Self medication for self preservation
I want to preserve
Your voice like epiphany calling down
From Mount Zion, earth is always the tail end of
An apostrophe, or the quotation, whichever you’d prefer — I 
can’t picture you 
having a preference for abbreviation but 
perhaps I wanted to hear 
a beat in your English and I 
am waiting for you to leave 
it, the language like a scorned lover. I 
have been tired of my mother tongue 
since I fell into it. A lifetime of exhaustion, 
remind me of how you divide time evenly 
to find the median, in time equal 
to the size of the parcels of division.
