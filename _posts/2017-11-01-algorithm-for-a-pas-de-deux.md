title: algorithm for a pas de deux
---

Point is a vertex and arched foot
Line of arms and line between
Voronoi is a tie-breaker algorithm
As the fouett√© is the tie breaker
For the pirouette as you hold
Me off the ground
2D points projected onto a 3D space
To find the smallest enclosing perimeter
Always smallest
Always tighter tighter tighter than you
Holding me to not scream
Holding me to contain myself
As the Delaunay contains the Voronoi
A dual of itself
A skeleton holds its body
And its body is just the marks on the floor
For how close we can step
To each other before we are
Pas de deux
