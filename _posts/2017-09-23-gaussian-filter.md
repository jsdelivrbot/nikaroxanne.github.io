Craft me one to suit
My need for an acceptable standard
Deviation away from the mean away from
My allotted level of self pity away from
A quarantined value of a proprietary amount of care
I could love 
You like I love triangles drawing them endlessly seeing them everywhere seeing you everywhere seeing you always on every face of every man who passes me in the street and sometimes at night I dream that we are walking around the banlieue together not for any reason other than the gross fact that I've claimed it as my own (I'm aware of my own (imposed) American imperialism; please forgive it) I'm aware I am trying to claim things I have no possession over. Today my friend asked me if you and I were close and I stuttered
I want to hold your hand while you cry about the burdens of masculinity -- tony does that until 3am today and I can't even fucking remember the last time a man was so goddamn emotionally vulnerable with me in a situation that Didn't make me want to vomit from the burden
I can find you like Chazelle
I want you to decompose yourself into triangles for me -- but I will take the burden. I will go first.
