title: I go out at night and act my age
---

What a peculiar behavior but I insist
Because my peers insist (they don’t, 
they don’t even recognize me, nor I them)
Because my mother insists
Because I insist
Ask myself to repeat

Remember last year when I slipped 
into a coma of nostalgia asked myself 
to remember myself from three years prior
asked myself to pretend 
and to feel, whatever it was
that I felt when I met him,
the first one before you.
There were a lot of firsts and there were
None, a discrete and non discrete value
The continuous null pointer the constant
Remainder of 0

I slip into the mass of bodies and this is
The familiar, an anonymity amidst many
I can recognize and name vaguely but not 
In terms that you would deem palatable or
Acceptable for the final submission of the 
Third draft of the paper
So many iterations and you never responded to
My inquiry, even to say no
It haunts me in a way I can’t even say
Out loud not even to
My mother, who tells me “go out and enjoy
Yourself, you never know what could happen”
But I do and I did and I will
Repeat call myself call you into blank
 Night air a blanket a curtain a monolith 
Of space and substance and that discrete
Non discrete null terminator exit condition

I move and I smirk and I picture
The dance floor as a Caravaggio painting
You as the compositionally aligned focal point
Pointing to yourself (recursive) telling
Me I will never stop wanting
You to be the only one as I step
Off the dance floor into the night into nothing to
Hold my hand as we smoke the mountain
Of cigarettes I have rolled and placed
Delicately in their Florence-origin holder to
Caress my cheek on the cruel April evening
As every evening because it is
Still you
The only resort I return to oasis
In the desert my tranquil stop 
On the metro, second to last on the line
Before nothing and you are
Always, watching me from the periphery of the room, 
smirking, bemused, asking me why I read the paper, 
why I had already read the paper,
months ago. Here is the answer: I was looking
for a way to reach you,
to speak in a tongue you would yield to,
to say, I give this up, this age for you
are the only thing keeping me
young and old and relatively
neither. Not my age not yours
