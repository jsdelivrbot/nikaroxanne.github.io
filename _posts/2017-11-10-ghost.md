The anguish will return to me.
I wait for it
It always does
And it will and I trace
Your skull with my finger pads
Sliced open on scissors crisped
Into a perfect sterile steel surface
Last Saturday, post concerts
(Plural, not an error; I double check
Always before utterance of
A parity. It is always less about what is
There than what isn’t)
She has allowed the ivories to infiltrate
Her poems and
It is a benevolent inquisition
This conquest
I delay saying
Any words for fear of their being
The wrong words so silence
Moves with me, like a phantom, always
A companion a backwards release for
I have been speaking louder or
Trying
But I still

I think of you always in a hum
Dull pain from the base of my neck
Searching upwards towards ascension
Like me always mobile into
Some cloud some iCloud some pretense
Of security in a satellite hovering
About my own body like
À voyeuse
I cannot blame it
I want it so I forgive

I wish my thoughts were like paperweights
So I could shatter them
You are so delicate in my mind and
It crippled me
At night your voice like an anvil to
Glue me to the sheets it
Is not sleep paralysis but tell
Me an English translation for toska
There is none so I loop

Every day like a rising call of church bells you
Ask for the proof
I cannot confirm or deny
The induction led to
My collusion
Non confirmation
My confirmation
Hail Marys whisper between the lines
To demand why I front such a religious propensity
I thought god lived in trees until
Now. Or until tomorrow
I will cling to the Rowan oak in
The meadow by the schoolyard because he
Whispers to me ideas that never
Crumpled into boredom or acquiescence

He tells me I am alive and I say okay:

Everyone on the train tries to decipher
Why I crinkle my brow when reading you
Explaining movements of lines to lines
(Not lines)
And it is only shapes on a page and I will
Draw pictures that map and remember
How you moved from Plato to Champlain
If you were here you could decipher
The other side of the conversation
But you already have
I’ve moved the planes
To a Euclidean present
And I say softly
But not as softly
That my grandmother was a philosopher
And she haunts me still in a way I won’t
Relinquish.
