<p>As a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, I am exploring computer science as a medium for artistic expression in the modern era. I spent my third year of university in Paris, where I studied at Université Paris I and III as well as L’école Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. I am currently a fifth-year student in the dual degree program at Tufts and the SMFA, where I am pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, French and Fine Arts. </p> 

<p> I love language in all its messy and broken forms and work to combine programming languages and "natural language" in my daily artistic practice. I am bilingual in English and French and I sporadically study Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Russian. After spending the first half of this year in an informal reading group at the Harvard Kennedy School - entitled "Algorithmic Transparency - I am dedicating this final year of my studies to delving deeper into the structure, power and poetry of algorithms.</p>

<p>This website serves as a portfolio for my visual artwork (painting, drawing, code-based works) as well as my writing portfolio (poetry and prose). </p>
