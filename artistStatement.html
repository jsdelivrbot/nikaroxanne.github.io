	<p> At the intersection of computer science and painting, my works finds a rooted commonality in themes of data, structure and form. </p> 

	<p> My work attempts to create a dialogue to dissect and map algorithms through human experience, and human experience through algorithms (vaguely, what Bernard Chazelle describes as "<a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/SeminarEvolvability/ChazelleNaturalAlgorithms.pdf" target= "_blank">natural algorithms</a>.") Through a process of layering diagrams, maps, observational drawings, notes, and annotations, my works become a tool for self-interrogation and self-reflection, a way to foster a dialogue between my own left and right brain and the oft-siloed hemispheres of "tech" and "art." </p> 

	<p> I am interested in algorithmic transparency, ethics in relation to technology, and the nature of power inherit in what is the action of coding - to hide or conceal or transform a piece of data, to make new from layers of old. </p>

	<p> The median-finding algorithm ended everything for me: a lifetime-spanning, automatic search for a desired form; a repetitive whiplash of scraping and peeling and never finding the correct pattern to yield that for which I was searching with an animalistic hunger. </p>

	<p> *** </p>

	<p> An algorithm is a series of instructions; that is less Ikea manual and more living, breathing body that it is broken and heaving; you have followed algorithms for your entire life and you have become one without your realizing it. </p>

	<p> *** </p>

	<p> A woodcut breathes in the same way that an algorithm does: a binary 1 and 0 division of information, a subtraction and addition of tic marks, of holes in the punch card. Information after all, finds its roots in “inform:” the word itself derived from the myth of Jupiter smashing his hammer to render physicality. Inform meant to give form, to break to give substance. </p>

	<p> *** </p>

	<p> Algorithmic transparency is less about www and more about DNA: always simple instructions boiled down to their most bare-bones skeletal frame. An algorithm has an anatomy that is hidden and composed and ordered and structured and pure so pure so damn pure that when I see one, I want to etch it into my skin and bones and type it into the muscles and registers of the cache. </p>

	<p> Da Vinci had it right in trying to collapse the world into the stolen anatomy from a morgue: post-internet post-human pre-post-body, watch me punch through the screen and claw out all the wires inside. </p>
