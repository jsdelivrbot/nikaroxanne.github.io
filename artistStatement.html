	<h2 class= "page-title"> Artist Statement </h2>

	<p> At the intersection of computer science and painting, my works finds a rooted commonality in themes of data, structure and form. </p> 

	<p> My work attempts to create a dialogue to dissect and map algorithms through human experience, and human experience through algorithms (vaguely, what Bernard Chazelle describes as "<a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/SeminarEvolvability/ChazelleNaturalAlgorithms.pdf" target= "_blank">natural algorithms</a>.") Through a process of layering diagrams, maps, observational drawings, notes, and annotations, my works become a tool for self-interrogation and self-reflection, a way to foster a dialogue between my own left and right brain and the oft-siloed hemispheres of "tech" and "art." </p> 

	<p> I am interested in algorithmic transparency, ethics in relation to technology, and the nature of power inherit in what is the action of coding - to hide or conceal or transform a piece of data, to make new from layers of old. </p>
